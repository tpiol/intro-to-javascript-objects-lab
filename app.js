Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

Hint: 
  - Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
  - Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another.
